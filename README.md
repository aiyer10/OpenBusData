# OpenBusData
A collection of scripts to analyse the BODS service provided by DfT

Back in Oct 2017, DfT worked alongside various bus operators in the UK to provide a collection of datasets dealing with 
1. Fares
2. Location and 
3. Timetables 
across the UK. 

This work is to explore the data provided with a view to answer a few questions such as 
1. Are the fares across the UK by the same provider the same per mile?
2. Given a county, can we assess those areas that are least serviced?
